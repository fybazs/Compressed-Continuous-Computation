# Compressed Continuous Computation (C3)
----------------------------------------

The Compressed Continuous Computation (C3) package is intended to make it easy to perform continuous linear and multilinear algebra with multidimensional functions. Common tasks include taking "matrix" decompositions of vector- or matrix-valued functions, adding or multiplying functions together, integrating multidimensional functions, and much much more.

## Installation / Getting started

The dependencies for this code are
   1) BLAS
   2) LAPACK

```
git clone https://github.com/goroda/Compressed-Continuous-Computation.git c3
cd c3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will install all shared libraries into c3/lib. The main shared library is libc3, the rest are all submodules. To install to a particular location use

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/choice
make install
```

## Configuration Options

#### BUILD_STATIC_LIB
Default: `OFF'

Using this option can toggle whether or not static or shared libraries should be built

## Systems I have tested on

Mac OS X with clang
Ubuntu with gcc
