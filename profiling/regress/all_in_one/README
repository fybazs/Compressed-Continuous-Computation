Notes:
1) maxorder = 5; ranks = 4, DIM=5,FUNC=3,NSAMPLE=1000
2) training data on cube of [0,1] but polynomials defined on [-1,1] (should fix)
3) After third.svg - Can probably further increase speed by 10% by storing legendre 
	                 polynomial evaluations
                     but such an optimization is limited to legendre polynomials. 
                     At this point it might be
                     worth exploring stochastic descent optimization algorithms
4) Was wrong, fourth and fifth result in speedup of 6 times. 80% speedup over first one

first.svg : working regression code, unoptimized, 
          : times = 59.576s 58.443s 54.347s (on work machine)

second.svg : increased memory requirement and reduced computation by creating a forward
             and backward sweep, storing all evaluations for each core required, 
           : times = 39.936s 40.268s 38.650s (on work machine)

third.svg  : improved vectorization in qmarray_param_grad_eval
           : times = 36.606s 37.964s 37.489s

fourth.svg : first attempt taking advantage of sparsity of gradients of cores during the
           : left to right multiplication (still need to do it for final multiplication with
           : the cores on the the right
           : times = 24.469s, 24.562s, 25.092s


fifth.svg  : take advantage of sparsity of gradients during right-to-left multiplication
           : times = 11.708s, 11.281s, 11.761s
